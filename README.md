## Features

- An **unique gamemode**, where **players can build** and even **create mini-games with coding**.
 It's completely new experience compared to classic Creative servers with plots.

- **A lot of options for worlds generation**: players can choose terrain (Flat, Empty, Ocean, Normal) and
 environment (Overworld, Nether, The End). You can add own custom generators (Flat, Folders) in config.yml.

- **Players can easily change their worlds** with settings. They can set a time, weather, game rules and world's name, description,
 icon and even set custom ID for join command.

- **It's better to create together**, because world owners can add players to builders, developers, white list or even ban list.
 Not trusted players will lose their permissions, when owner leaves the server.

- **Coding on blocks** allows players to create mini-games. With simple and friendly syntax, 120+ events, 320+ actions, 90 conditions, 
 9 values and variables it's easy to code something cool.

- **Built-in security things**. Plugin has redstone limiter, bad items fixer and lobby protection. 
 You can achieve more security by using [WorldGuard](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/worldguard), [Panilla](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/panilla-prevent-hacked-items.65694/),
 [CoreProtect](https://modrinth.com/plugin/coreprotect) and other plugins. 

- Change messages, items names, descriptions and even plugin sounds as you want, because it's **translatable**. By default we have English and Russian translations.

- You can get donations by players by adding **player groups** in config.yml with custom limits, cooldowns,
  lobby permissions, world permissions, world advertisement price and like reward amount.

- Be able to **execute any commands by console or player** on different events: Lobby Teleport, World Join, World Quit, World Chat,
  Global Chat, Maintenance Start, Maintenance End. Useful, if you have some plugins (Skript, MyCommand) to do your own things without 
  rewriting the plugin.

- Add more features with other plugins:
  - [Vault](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/vault.34315/) - Adds economy support.
  - [ProtocolLib](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/protocollib.1997/) - Adds coding chests animations, glowing blocks while selecting location.
  - [LibsDisguises](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/libs-disguises-free.81/) - Adds entity disguise action.
  - [PlaceholderAPI](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/placeholderapi.6245/) - Adds placeholders and parses them in some messages (world join, world icon).

- Plugin **developers can easily add own** [world generators](https://gitlab.com/eagles-creative/opencreative/-/wikis/home/Configuration/World-Generators), [coding platformers](https://gitlab.com/eagles-creative/opencreative/-/wikis/Plugin-Development/Coding-Platformers), [coding placeholders, coding game values](https://gitlab.com/eagles-creative/opencreative/-/wikis/Plugin-Development/Adding-new-features)
 and [set their managers](https://gitlab.com/eagles-creative/opencreative/-/wikis/Plugin-Development/Managers) (economy, packets). Also we have our plugin events (Lobby Teleport, World Chat, Global Chat, Maintenance Start/End,
 4 module events, 10 world events), so you can listen on them,
 maybe cancel and execute your code. 

 - You're welcome to create forks of this plugin, because it's **open-sourced**. Download source code, edit it, publish it
 and use on your own servers.

Coding blocks will be parsed into codeScript.yml.
Example: Send a message "Hello world!"

```yaml
code:
  blocks:
    exec_block_4_1:
      category: EVENT_PLAYER
      type: PLAYER_JOIN
      actions:
        action_block1:
          category: PLAYER_ACTION
          type: PLAYER_SEND_MESSAGE
          arguments:
            type:
              type: TEXT
              value: join-spaces
            messages:
              type: LIST
              value:
                '1':
                  type: TEXT
                  value:
                    name: Hello
                '2':
                  type: TEXT
